## Slide 2: Introduction
- **What is the project about?**
  - A batch processing application to handle student exam results.
  - Reads data from a CSV file, calculates grades, and stores results in a database.
- **Key Features**:
  - Batch Processing with Spring Batch.
  - Multi-threading for parallel processing.
  - Error handling for invalid data.

---

## Slide 3: What is Batch Processing?
- **Definition**:
  - Batch processing is a method of running large, repetitive jobs (e.g., processing thousands of records) without manual intervention.
- **Examples**:
  - Processing bank transactions.
  - Generating monthly reports.
  - Handling exam results (like in this project).
- **Why Batch Processing?**
  - Efficient for large datasets.
  - Reduces manual effort.
  - Can be scheduled to run automatically.

## Slide 4: What is Spring Batch?
- **Definition**:
  - Spring Batch is a lightweight framework for batch processing in Java.
  - Built on top of the Spring Framework.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Job**: A batch process (e.g., processing exam results).
  - **Step**: A phase within a job (e.g., reading data, processing data, writing data).
  - **ItemReader**: Reads data (e.g., from a CSV file).
  - **ItemProcessor**: Processes data (e.g., calculates grades).
  - **ItemWriter**: Writes data (e.g., to a database).
- **Why Spring Batch?**
  - Provides ready-to-use components for batch processing.
  - Supports retry and error handling.
  - Integrates well with Spring Boot.

## Slide 5: What is Multi-threading?
- **Definition**:
  - Multi-threading is the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently.
- **Why Multi-threading?**
  - Improves performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
  - Reduces processing time for large datasets.
- **In This Project**:
  - Spring Batch's `TaskExecutor` is used to process student records in parallel.

## Slide 6: Project Architecture
- **Overview**:
  - The project follows a simple batch processing architecture:
    1. **Read**: Data is read from a CSV file.
    2. **Process**: Grades are calculated based on marks.
    3. **Write**: Results are saved to a database.

## Slide 7: Key Components of the Project
1. **Student Entity**:
 - Represents a student with fields like `rollNumber`, `name`, `marks`, and `grade`.
2. **CSV File**:
 - Contains student data (e.g., `rollNumber`, `name`, `marks`).
3. **Batch Configuration**:
 - Defines the job, steps, and multi-threading setup.
4. **ItemReader**:
 - Reads data from the CSV file.
5. **ItemProcessor**:
 - Calculates grades based on marks.
6. **ItemWriter**:
 - Saves processed data to the database.
7. **TaskExecutor**:
 - Enables multi-threading for parallel processing.

## Slide 8: How It Works
1. **Step 1: Read Data**:
 - The `ItemReader` reads student data from the CSV file.
2. **Step 2: Process Data**:
 - The `ItemProcessor` calculates grades (e.g., A, B, C, D) based on marks.
3. **Step 3: Write Data**:
 - The `ItemWriter` saves the processed data to the database.
4. **Multi-threading**:
 - The `TaskExecutor` processes multiple records in parallel.

---

## Slide 9: Error Handling
- **What is Error Handling?**
- The process of detecting and resolving errors during batch processing.
- **In This Project**:
- Invalid records (e.g., negative marks or missing data) are logged and skipped.

---

## Slide 10: Technologies Used
- **Java 17**: Programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Spring Batch**: Framework for batch processing.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for storing results.
- **Lombok**: Library for reducing boilerplate code.
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management tool.
